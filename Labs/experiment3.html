    <h1>Organic Chemistry Lab Technique: Crystallization</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this experiment is to introduce the lab technique of crystallization, which is commonly used in the Organic chemistry
        lab setting to purify crude solids. The experiment objective is to carry out crystallization of impure Acetahilide and prove its
        purity by the melting point chemical property.
